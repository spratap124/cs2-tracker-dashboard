# CS2 Price Tracker - Demo Recording Script

## Introduction (0:00 - 0:15)

**[Screen: Landing on the application homepage]**

"Hey everyone! Welcome to the CS2 Price Tracker Dashboard. If you're a CS2 skin enthusiast who wants to buy or sell skins at the perfect time, this is the tool for you."

"Today, I'm going to show you how this application helps you track CS2 skin prices and get instant notifications when prices hit your target levels."

---

## Problem Statement (0:15 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Continue showing the application]**

"As a CS2 player, you know that skin prices fluctuate constantly. Maybe you're holding a knife waiting for the price to go up, or you're looking to buy a skin when it drops to your target price."

"The challenge? You can't sit there refreshing the Steam market all day. That's where CS2 Price Tracker comes in."

"Simply visit suryapratap.in/projects/cs2-price-tracker.html, and you'll get instant Discord notifications the moment prices cross your target thresholds."

---

## Initial Setup - Discord Webhook (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Action: Click on Settings/User Settings button]**

"Let's get started. First, you'll need to set up your Discord webhook for notifications."

**[Action: Show the settings modal]**

"Click on Settings, and you'll see the user settings panel. Here, you'll enter your Discord webhook URL. Don't worry, if you're not sure how to create one, it's simple - just go to your Discord server settings, create a webhook, and paste the URL here."

**[Action: Enter a Discord webhook URL (you can use a placeholder or actual one)]**

"Once you've entered your webhook and saved it, the system will create your account and give you a unique User ID. You can save this ID or your webhook URL to recover your account later."

**[Action: Save the settings]**

"Perfect! Your account is now set up."

## Adding Your First Tracker - Selling Scenario (1:00 - 1:45)

**[Action: Click "Add Tracker" button]**

"Now let's add a tracker. Let's say you own an AK-47 Redline Field-Tested and you want to sell it when the price reaches a certain level."

**[Action: Fill in the form]**

- **Skin Name**: "AK-47 | Redline (Field-Tested)"
- **Interest**: "Sell"
- **Target Up**: "2500" (explain: "This means you want to be notified when the price goes UP to $25 or above")
- **Target Down**: Leave empty or set a lower value

"Notice the Interest field - you can select 'Buy' if you're looking to purchase, or 'Sell' if you own the skin and want to sell it at the right price."

**[Action: Save the tracker]**

"Great! The tracker has been added. Now the system will monitor the Steam market price for this skin 24/7."

---

## Viewing Your Trackers (1:45 - 2:15)

**[Screen: Show the tracker card/list view]**

"Let's look at what you can see on the dashboard. Each tracker shows you:"

- "The skin image"
- "Current market price"
- "Your target prices - Target Down and Target Up"
- "The Interest badge - whether you're looking to Buy or Sell"
- "Alert status indicators showing if notifications have been sent"

**[Action: Toggle between Tile and List view]**

"You can switch between Tile view for a visual overview, or List view for more detailed information."

**[Action: Try different sort options]**

"And you can sort by name, price, date added, or target prices to organize your trackers however you like."

---

## Adding a Buy Tracker (2:15 - 2:45)

**[Action: Click "Add Tracker" again]**

"Now let's add another tracker - this time for a skin you want to BUY."

**[Action: Fill in another form]**

- **Skin Name**: "Karambit | Fade (Factory New)" (or another popular knife)
- **Interest**: "Buy"
- **Target Down**: "3500" (explain: "You want to be notified when the price DROPS to $35 or below - that's your buy opportunity!")
- **Target Up**: Leave empty

"See the difference? When your Interest is 'Buy', you want to know when the price goes DOWN so you can purchase at a lower price."

**[Action: Save]**

"Perfect! Now you're tracking both a skin you want to sell and one you want to buy."

---

## Price Tracking Features (2:45 - 3:15)

**[Screen: Show the dashboard with multiple trackers]**

"Here's what makes this powerful:"

**[Point to current price]** "The dashboard shows real-time current market prices from Steam."

**[Point to target prices]** "You can see your target prices clearly marked."

**[Point to color coding]** "Notice the color coding - green indicates good news for your interest. For selling, green means the price went up. For buying, green means the price went down."

**[Action: Point to totals section if visible]**

"If you have multiple skins set to sell, you can see your total sell value, which automatically accounts for Steam's 15% transaction fee, so you know exactly how much you'll receive."

---

## Notification System (3:15 - 3:45)

**[Screen: Show an example tracker with alert indicators]**

"When a price crosses your target threshold, you'll receive an instant notification in your Discord server."

**[Point to alert indicators if visible on screen]**

"You can see here that alerts have been sent. The system tracks when your target prices are hit, so you know exactly when to take action."

"This means you don't have to constantly check the market - the app does the work for you and notifies you immediately when your conditions are met."

---

## Account Recovery (3:45 - 4:00)

**[Action: Open Settings again]**

"One more important feature - account recovery. If you ever need to access your account from a different device, you can recover it using your Discord webhook URL."

**[Action: Show the recovery option]**

"Just enter your webhook URL, click 'Recover Account', and you'll regain access to all your trackers instantly."

---

## Wrap-up and Call to Action (4:00 - 4:30)

## Additional Tips for Recording:

1. **Pacing**: Take natural pauses between sections. Don't rush through the interface.
2. **Cursor Movement**: Move your cursor smoothly to highlight elements as you talk about them.
3. **Zoom/Highlight**: Use browser zoom or screen recording effects to highlight important UI elements.
4. **Real Examples**: Use actual popular CS2 skin names for authenticity (e.g., "AK-47 | Redline", "Karambit | Fade", "M4A4 | Howl").
5. **Error Handling**: If something doesn't load immediately, acknowledge it naturally ("The system is fetching the latest price...") and continue.
6. **Visual Emphasis**: Pause briefly when showing important information like price changes, totals, or alert indicators.
7. **Background Music**: Consider adding subtle background music for a more professional feel (but keep it low).
8. **B-roll**: You might want to show a Discord notification example as a cutaway if possible.
